# CollabSynth - Collorative music player

This started out as a node.js exercise and html/css/js practice
Collaborative synthesizer similar to Yamaha's Tenori-on

# TODO

* Refactor code (it's sloppy)
* Switch to CSS3 animations as opposed to raphael.js
* Add sanity check for syncing changes
* Add visual effects (waves)
* Add multiple sound boards
* Add usernames?
* Chat?
